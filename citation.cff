  # Synchronization


  Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to
  synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your Google
  Drive, your Dropbox and your GitHub accounts. This allows you to keep writing
  on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate
  easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every
  minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file
  modifications.


  There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:


  - The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings
  automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other
  device.

  &gt; To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.


  - The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one
  or multiple files in Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub.

  &gt; Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the
  Synchronize sub-menu.


  ## Open a file


  You can open a file from Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub by opening the
  Synchronize sub-menu and clicking Open from. Once opened in the workspace, any
  modification in the file will be automatically synced.


  ## Save a file


  You can save any file of the workspace to Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub by
  opening the Synchronize sub-menu and clicking Save on. Even if a file in the
  workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit
  can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.


  ## Synchronize a file


  Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will
  periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge
  will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.


  If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the
  Synchronize now button in the navigation bar.


  &gt; Note: The Synchronize now button is disabled if you have no file to
  synchronize.


  ## Manage file synchronization


  Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage
  synchronized locations by clicking File synchronization in the Synchronize
  sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are
  linked to your file.



  # Publication


  Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files.
  Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting
  platforms like Blogger, Dropbox, Gist, GitHub, Google Drive, WordPress and
  Zendesk. With Handlebars templates (http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full
  control over what you export.


  &gt; Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the Publish
  sub-menu.
